### Business Understanding


#### Walmart is an American retail corporation that operates a chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores.




#### In this project, we focused to answer the following questions:
1. Which store has minimum and maximum sales?
2. Which store has maximum standard deviation i.e., the sales vary a lot. Also, find out the coefficient of mean to standard deviation
3. Which store/s has good quarterly growth rate in Q3’2012
4. Some holidays have a negative impact on sales. Find out holidays which have higher sales than the mean sales in non-holiday season for all stores together
5. Provide a monthly and semester view of sales in units and give insights
6. Build prediction to forecast demand.
