#Data Analysis Project: Analyzing Sales Trends and Forecasting Demand for Walmart

1. Introduction:
Walmart, a prominent American retail corporation, operates various types of stores, including hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores. In this data analysis project, our primary objective is to extract valuable insights from Walmart's sales data to aid in decision-making and strategizing. We addressed specific questions and tasks outlined below to gain a comprehensive understanding of sales patterns and forecast demand accurately.

2. Questions and Tasks:

a. Identified Stores with Minimum and Maximum Sales: Determined which store exhibits the lowest and highest sales figures, provided insights into the performance variation across different locations.

b. Assessing Sales Variability: Calculated the standard deviation of sales for each store, we identified the store with the maximum sales variability. Additionally, we  computed the coefficient of mean to standard deviation to understand the dispersion of sales relative to the mean.

c. Analyzing Quarterly Growth Rate: Focusing on Q3’2012, Identiied stores with significant quarterly growth rates, offering insights into stores experiencing rapid expansion during this period.

d. Impact of Holidays on Sales: Certain holidays might impact sales negatively. So we identified holidays where sales surpass the mean sales during non-holiday periods, providing insights into consumer behavior during festive seasons.

e. Monthly and Semester Sales Overview: Provided a comprehensive view of sales trends on a monthly and semester basis, analyzed sales in units to uncover seasonal patterns and trends.

f. Demand Forecasting: Leveraging predictive modeling techniques,  built a demand forecasting model to predict future sales accurately, aiding in inventory management and resource allocation.

#Methodology:

Data Collection: We collected historical sales data from Walmart's various stores, ensuring data integrity and completeness.
Data Cleaning: In the Pre-processing steps we involve  missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies to ensure data quality.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Through descriptive statistics, data visualization, and correlation analysis, we  gained insights into the distribution, trends, and relationships within the dataset.
Statistical Analysis: We employed statistical techniques to address specific questions, such as calculating standard deviation, growth rates, and identified significant events like holidays.
Forecasting Model Development: Utilizing time-series forecasting techniques, we developed a robust demand forecasting model based on historical sales data.
Model Evaluation: We assessed the accuracy and performance of the forecasting model using appropriate evaluation metrics and cross-validation techniques.

# Data Understanding
The data contains these features:
- Store - the store number
- Date - the week of sales
- Weekly_Sales - sales for the given store
- Holiday_Flag - whether the week is a special holiday week 1 – Holiday week 0 – Non-holiday week
- Temperature - Temperature on the day of sale
- Fuel_Price - Cost of fuel in the region
- CPI – Prevailing consumer price index
- Unemployment - Prevailing unemployment rate

#Conclusion:
Through comprehensive data analysis and forecasting, we ganined gain valuable insights into sales trends, consumer behavior, and demand dynamics. By leveraging these insights, Walmart can make informed decisions to drive growth, enhance customer satisfaction, and maintain its position as a leading retail corporation.
